Understanding Convolutional Kernels:
- Convolutional kernels (or filters) are small matrices used to apply effects like blurring, sharpening, edge detection, etc., to an image.
- First, the bottom-right kernel forward propagates a 1 only if it’s focused on a horizontal line segment. 
The bottom-left kernel forward propagates a 1 only if it’s focused on a diagonal 
line pointing upward and to the right.
- It’s important to realize that this technique allows each kernel to learn a particular pattern and then search for the existence of that pattern somewhere in the image.

Filters (Kernels) as Feature Detectors:
- In a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), each filter (or kernel) learns to detect specific features in the input data, such as edges, textures, or patterns.
- During training, the filters are adjusted through backpropagation to minimize the loss function. This process tunes the filter weights to respond strongly to particular features in the data.

Weight Sharing:
- In CNNs, the same filter (or kernel) is applied across different parts of the input image. This is known as weight sharing.
- During the convolution operation, the filter slides (or convolves) over the input image, applying the same set of weights to different spatial locations.
- The number of filters determines how many different features the network can learn simultaneously.

How Weights Learn Multiple Things Simultaneously
- Multiple Filters:
-- In each convolutional layer, there are multiple filters, each initialized with different weights. Each filter learns to detect different features independently.
For example, one filter might learn to detect vertical edges, another might learn to detect horizontal edges, and another might learn to detect textures.
- Hierarchical Learning:
-- CNNs learn features hierarchically. Early layers learn low-level features (e.g., edges, corners), and deeper layers learn more complex, high-level features (e.g., shapes, objects).
-- Each layer builds upon the features learned by the previous layers, enabling the network to learn a wide variety of features at different levels of abstraction.
- Backpropagation and Gradient Descent:
-- During training, the network performs forward propagation to compute the output and then uses backpropagation to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to each weight.
-- Gradient descent is used to update the weights, allowing the network to learn multiple features simultaneously by adjusting the weights based on the gradients computed from the loss function.

Practical Example
- Consider an image classification task where you want to classify images of cats and dogs. During training:
Early Layers: The filters in the early layers might learn to detect edges and textures common to both cats and dogs.
Intermediate Layers: Filters might learn to detect parts of animals, such as eyes, fur patterns, and ears.
Deeper Layers: Filters might learn to detect entire objects (e.g., a whole cat or dog).
